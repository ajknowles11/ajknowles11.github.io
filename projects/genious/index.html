            <p>For our final project in Computer Game Programming, students suggested a large list of themes and mechanics which could serve as inspiration for making a game, and teams were created by grouping students who were interested in the same one. My team, consisting of myself and three others, chose to make a game involving "non-Euclidean geometry," eventually settling on portals as a core mechanic.</p>
            <p>I've written a <a href="/projects/portals/">separate write-up</a> describing the implementation of portals, so this page will focus on other aspects of the game's design.</p>
            <div class="item">
                <h2 class="front-header">Overview</h2>
                <p>"Help! I'm Trapped in the Psychedelic Time Dimension Again (Second Time This Week)" is a short first-person puzzle game with portal mechanics. Players are thrust into a high-contrast alternate world and must navigate through different rooms using portals, which can be activated or rotated using various switches and buttons around the levels.</p>
                <p>The game takes around 5 minutes to complete. The puzzles are mostly straightforward, intending to showcase a bunch of different possible interactions with portals. While the later rooms can be quite complicated, the game doesn't have any "fail" states, so walking around and interacting with things until you win is an effective strategy.</p>
                <p>At CMU's 2023 Game Creation Society Release Festival, our game won a few awards within our class, including best writing, graphics, gameplay, and overall quality.</p>
                <p>The obnoxiously long title of the game was chosen as a joke, intended to set up the unseriousness of our game's narrative. The name of our development team, "Genious," was chosen because our professor was wearing a <a href="https://dashare.zone/listing/im-right-the-opinion-genious?product=369">da share z0ne shirt</a> on our last day to decide, and we had no other ideas.</p>

                <h2 class="front-header">Development</h2>
                <p>When we initially started designing this project, we were inspired by visualizations of hyperbolic and spherical spaces, such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1256230/Hyperbolica/">Hyperbolica</a>. However, we decided against ... too engine-heavy, non engine people would be useless for beginning of project (can't help, can't plan since mechanics determined by what we can figure out)... too much research let's just make a game.
                <p>Talk about evolution of scope, going from hyberbolic to just portals, and then abandoning the subtle portal sections in favor of more test chambers</p>
                <p>We already knew it would be kinda walksim-y, but didn't want just a tech demo.</p>
                <p>Quick mention of themes/meaning, was gonna be more hopeless but in the end milk is silly enough but still a good enough goal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h2 class="front-header">Featured Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Walkmesh allows ceiling and wall portals, levers to activate/deactivate, portals are two sided! that's cool. also nothing stopping us from moving portals around so let's rotate. Last level is a mess but has everything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h2 class="front-header">Actually Making the Game</h2>
                <p>Talk about blender tools and scripting here, and deciding the final levels</p>
                <p>Mention shortcuts (text is just pre-rendered image)</p>
                <p>Despite enforced early deadlines, still feels like our whole game was made in last week (prototypes didn't really relate to final game too much, level designs discarded). Partially due to slow portal development, but I think we just needed to plan on paper better.</p>

                <h2 class="front-header">Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Even with modified scope, would have liked a nature section with subtle portal stuff, more milk jugs laid around to make theme more present throughout gameplay, and a way to fail. Also better soundtrack.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <p>still met our goals and made a working portal game that won stuff</p>
