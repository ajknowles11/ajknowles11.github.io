            <p>For my final project in Computer Game Programming, my group and I decided to focus on using portals to create non-Euclidean spaces. This page describes my custom implementation in OpenGL, designed to support many sets of seamless, recursive portals. For information about the actual game we made, click <a href="/projects/genious">here.</a></p>
            <p>The implementation supports up to 255 levels of recursion, for any amount of portals, and is reasonably performant on weak hardware (though there is room for improvement, such as more advanced culling).</p>

                <h2 class="front-header">First Attempts</h2>
                <p>Going into this project I wasn't very comfortable working with the stencil buffer. Actually, I wasn't super comfortable with OpenGL in general. My previous projects in the course got a lot of mileage out of the professor's starter code for the renderer as I wasn't doing much that was interesting graphically, instead focusing on gameplay mechanics. This made portals seem like a pretty difficult choice for a final project, but I knew I would at least learn a good amount.</p>
                <p>My first thought was to use framebuffers to render a camera view into a texture, something I was familiar with doing in game engines in the past. However, I somehow stumbled upon the idea of using stencil buffers, which was preferable for a couple of reasons:
                    <ul class="inline-list">
                        <li class="bulleted spaced">Rendering to a texture could cause aliasing when close to a portal without high resolution</li>
                        <li class="bulleted spaced">Such high resolution textures could be memory heavy, especially with many different sets of portals</li>
                        <li class="bulleted spaced">I just wanted to learn to use the stencil buffer after briefly interacting with it in Unreal Engine</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>My mind was fully set when I found a <a href="https://th0mas.nl/2013/05/19/rendering-recursive-portals-with-opengl/">nice article by Thomas Rinsma</a> describing his own implementation of recursive stencil buffer-based portals. I decided that I would start with implementing single portal rendering with functionality, and then adapt Thomas's method in my codebase.</p>
                <p>Getting one portal to work was pretty straightforward. I gave the portal (and its destination) a local camera which would update position each frame, and I rendered the portal meshes into the stencil buffer, followed by their cameras' views into the depth/color buffer, and then finally the player camera as usual. For teleportation I basically checked if the player crossed the portal's XZ plane while within the mesh's bounding box, using some simple matrix math with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWpFZbjtSQg">Sebastian Lague.</a></p>
                <div class="d-flex flex-wrap flex-column flex-md-row item">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>The trickiest part of this was clipping objects rendered through portals to the actual portal's plane: by default, an object behind portal B could be visible when looking through portal A, out B's front side.</p>
                        <p>Notice in the image how the red cube is visible within the blue portal, even though it is on the back side of the orange portal. Luckily this is easily fixed in OpenGL by setting glClipPlanes[0] in the meshes' shaders.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img class="img-fluid w-100" src="no_clip_plane.jpg">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>With that, single portal rendering was done, and I could move on to implementing Thomas's solution for recursion.</p>
                <p>This wasn't trivial, as I was still getting into the recursive mindset- for example, I started off with a Portal struct which had a Camera member, but I started to realize that recursion would only work if view matrices were calculated at each depth rather than once per frame, since the same portal would effectively need to be viewed from multiple perspectives.</p>
                <img class="content-md mx-auto d-block" src="recursion_compare.jpg">
                <p>Even with that fixed, though, I found that my adaptation of Thomas's solution didn't work nicely with multiple sets of portals. In particular, portals were not able to correctly occlude each other.</p>
                <img class="content-md mx-auto d-block" src="no_occlude.jpg">
                <p>I realized that I needed to store depth information from each portal at the same recursive layer in order to allow later-drawn portals to be occluded if necessary. The current implementation sometimes called glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT), which didn't support conditional operation based on stencil buffer value. Therefore I opted to replace these calls with drawing a fullscreen triangle at max depth, which was compatible with the stencil test.</p>
                <p>The rest of my implementation simply follows from making that adjustment work, so let's now take a look at the algorithm.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="implementation" class="item">
                <h2 class="front-header">Recursive Implementation</h2>
                <p>The algorithm is a recursive function outlined as follows:</p>
                <p>For each active, visible portal:</p>
                <ol class="inline-list">
                    <li class="spaced">Enable stencil write only, and depth/stecil test.</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Set the stencil test to pass where stencil value equals current recursion level, and increment the buffer by 1 on depth and stencil pass.</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Draw the portal into the stencil buffer, incrementing it, and set glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, recursion_lvl + 1, 0xFF), allowing drawing only within this new portal.</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Clear the depth and color buffer within the newly drawn portal. To do this we enable color and depth writing, disable stencil writing, and drawing a fullscreen triangle with glDepthFunc(GL_ALWAYS) and glDepthRange(1,1) and output color equal to our glClearColor. Then we reset glDepthFunc(GL_LESS) and glDepthRange(0,1).</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Calculate a new camera transform, representing where the player would be looking from if they were already teleported.</li>
                    <li class="spaced">If we are at max recursion level, simply draw all objects into color and depth within the portal view. Otherwise, recurse, passing our new camera transform as the view point.</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Disable color writing, enable stencil and depth writing. Set depth to always pass and stencil to pass inside the new portal (glStencilFunc(GL_EQUAL, recursion_lvl + 1, 0xFF)).</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Set glStencilOp to decrement on stencil and depth test pass, and draw the portal into stencil and depth buffers. This decrements our stencil buffer back to what it was before we drew the portal the first time, and sets up depth to let our portal occlude and be occluded.</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Reset the depth comparison function to GL_LESS.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Then, just once per recursive function:</p>
                <ol class="inline-list" start="10">
                    <li class="spaced">Set stencil test to pass when the buffer is greater than or equal to current recursion level (preventing us from drawing outside whatever portal's view is being drawn this call).</li>
                    <li class="spaced">Disable stencil write, and draw all the normal scene objects into depth/color normally.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The actual implementation can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/ajknowles11/OpenGLPortalDemo/blob/main/Scene.cpp">source code,</a> specifically Scene::Draw() in Scene.cpp.</p>
                <p>This approach is basically the same as Thomas's, using the stencil buffer value to represent depth levels, or how many portals we see into when drawing. We draw the scene by traversing portal views depth-first, incrementing the stencil buffer on the way up and decrementing once a specific portal view has finished drawing.</p>
                <p>As mentioned, the main differences lie in handling the depth buffer, as this implementation takes care to never clear the entire thing in order to let portals occlude each other correctly (see step 4).</p>

            <div class="item">
                <h2 class="front-header">Clipping Planes</h2>
                <p>If you do look through the source, you may notice some stuff about clip planes that I didn't mention in the algorithm. One purpose is to avoid drawing objects behind portals as discussed in the single portal section, but there's another important purpose- making teleportation seamless.</p>
                <p>Seamless teleportation was extremely important to the game we were developing, and one thing Sebastian Lague mentioned was the possibility of seeing behind a portal incorrectly up close, if the player angled their camera such that the near plane intersected with the portal plane.</p>
                <p>This was easily fixed by using a cuboid for the portal rather than a flat plane and drawing on both front and back faces. However, a flickering issue persisted.</p>
                <p>Our teleportation worked by checking for the player crossing the middle of the portal bounding box, then teleporting them to the same relative position in the destination portal as they had in the source portal. But a player crossing the middle of a portal can still be within the bounding box, meaning they would be looking at the inside of the destination portal once teleported, which would show the view from the source portal.</p>
                <div class="d-flex flex-wrap flex-column flex-md-row item">
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="fullbox_0.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="fullbox_1.jpg">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>My solution to this was to detect which side of the portal the player was viewing from, and clip the portal such that it only drew the opposite side. This way, if a player crossed the middle of a source portal (looking through the source portal, showing the destination's view), they would not see any part of the destination portal after teleporting, avoiding the problem.</p>

                <h2 class="front-header">Optimizations / Room for Improvement</h2>
                <p>There were many parts of the game which featured multiple sets of recursive portals, and getting good performance could sometimes be tricky without some situational hacks.</p>
                <p>I think a major improvement that still needs to be made is better frustum culling. Right now we have a fairly simple implementation which ignores portals outside the frustum view, but during recursive calls the frustum retains its size rather than clamping to the edges of the previous portal. This is a bit wasteful.</p>
                <p>We also don't perform culling on normal objects. I had plans to make a more efficient scene data structure like a BVH for culling purposes but had to abandon it for time reasons. I still may revisit this in the future, as I've been doing something similar with Vulkan for another class.</p>
                <p>It's also worth looking into more dynamic scene loading. The portal demo doesn't have too many meshes but our game had its entire level being rendered every frame, which I suspect is the main factor behind high frame time when there is high portal recursion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h2 class="front-header">Final Notes</h2>
                <p>You can find the teleportation mechanic implementation in PlayMode.cpp in the <a href="https://github.com/ajknowles11/OpenGLPortalDemo/blob/main/PlayMode.cpp">source code.</a> You might notice that the demo uses a walkmesh for movement rather than a physics-based solution. I discuss the reasons for this (mainly convenience-related) in my writeup of the game this system was developed for, which you can read <a href="/projects/genious/">here.</a></p>
                <p>If I were to use a physics-based system instead, the player teleportation would be handled mostly the same, just without all the walkmesh stuff.</p>
                <p>Since I was mainly concerned with the rendering side of things, we also didn't develop support for putting other objects through portals, or seeing yourself through a portal. I didn't have time during the semester, but neither were necessary for the game we made.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <img class="content-md mx-auto d-block" src="tour.gif">
                <p>I'm quite pleased with these portals and I'm glad I got them working in time for our final project. I feel much more comfortable with OpenGL and graphics in general after spending hours debugging in RenderDoc. Lately, I've been working on a Vulkan engine supporting a similar method of rendering portals, in which I plan on eventually integrating the Jolt physics library.</p>
