            <h1 class="front-header">About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Andrew, a programmer and game developer who studied at Carnegie Mellon University, studying mathematics (discrete math and logic, specifically) and game design. I was initially interested in math research, but then decided to focus more on computer science because I enjoyed modding games like Minecraft.</p>
            <!-- chains link image and link maybe -->
            <p>I decided to try out the Godot game engine one time because I was fed up with insufficient documentation for modding Call of Duty, and I reasoned that it might be easier to make my own games than try to mess with someone else's.</p>
            <p>A friend eventually convinced me to join my school's <a href="https://www.gamecreation.org/">Game Creation Society</a>, where I really fell in love with game development. I learned to use Unity and Unreal, and branched out into building for XR. Now, making games is my main interest, but any kind of 3D development is enjoyable.</p>

            <h2 class="front-header">Education</h2>
            <p>At CMU, I've studied a variety of mathematical topics such as linear algebra, combinatorics, set theory, and calculus, as well as various theoretical CS courses on data structures, algorithms, and systems.</p>
            <p>I wanted to take the Computer Game Programming course, which required studying Computer Graphics first. These ended up being my favorite two classes I've taken at CMU and are the reason I've started focusing more on graphics for the last year or so (my <a href="/projects/genious/">final project</a> in Game Programming in particular was very influential).</p>

            <h2 class="front-header">Hobbies/Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy spending time in the gym and getting stronger. I don't really have interest in becoming a big body builder but there's something satisfying about being able to do a bunch of pull ups, or benching more than your body weight for the first time.</p>
            <p>I used to go bouldering a lot, but as I've become busier I've mostly replaced it with regular gym workouts. Still like to go every once in a while.</p>
            <p>I recently got into cosplay with my school's club. I used to make prop weapons from COD Zombies when I was a kid so it's been fun to revisit that type of creative work, which is a nice change of pace from my usual computer-oriented interests.</p>
            <p>And obviously, I love playing games. Lately it's been lots of Overwatch 2, some Minecraft. My favorite games of all time probably consist of Outer Wilds, Tunic, Elden Ring, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Minecraft, Terraria, and Black Ops III.</p>
