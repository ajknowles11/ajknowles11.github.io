            <h1 class="front-header">About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Andrew, a senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying discrete math and game design. I came to school wanting to do math research for some reason, then decided to focus more on computer science because I enjoyed modding games like Minecraft.</p>
            <!-- chains link image and link here, say how many downloads and how its unmaintained ahh -->
            <p>I decided to try out the Godot game engine one time because I was fed up with insufficient documentation for modding Call of Duty, and I reasoned that I would rather make my own games with insufficient documentation than try to mess with someone else's.</p>
            <p>A friend eventually convinced me to join my school's <a href="https://www.gamecreation.org/">Game Creation Society</a>, where I really fell in love with game development. I learned to use Unity and Unreal, and branched out into building for XR. Now making games is my main interest.</p>

        <div class="base border-bottom">
            <h2 class="front-header">Education</h2>
            <p>At CMU, I've studied a variety of mathematical topics such as linear algebra, combinatorics, set theory, and calculus, as well as various theoretical CS courses on data structures, algorithms, and systems.</p>
            <p>I wanted to take the Computer Game Programming course, which required studying Computer Graphics first. These ended up being my favorite two classes I've taken at CMU and are the reason I've started focusing more on graphics for the last year or so (my <a href="/projects/genious/">final project</a> in Game Programming in particular was very influential).</p>
            <p>I like to play up my disinterest in math as a joke, since it's my major. It's true that as school has gone on I've wanted to focus more on CS and game courses and less on math ones, but that doesn't mean I'm not still interested in the math I'm doing all the time in my life. Besides the fun math in 3D graphics, I actually returned to discrete math research this past year when a friend approached me with a simple yet elegantly-structured problem (<a href="">paper here</a>).</p>

            <h2 class="front-header">Hobbies/Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy spending time in the gym and getting stronger. I don't really have interest in becoming a big body builder but there's something satisfying about being able to do a bunch of pull ups, or benching more than your body weight for the first time.</p>
            <p>I used to go bouldering a lot, but as I've become busier I've almost fully replaced it with regular gym workouts. Still like to go every once in a while.</p>
            <p>I recently got into cosplay with my school's club. I used to make prop weapons from COD Zombies when I was a kid so I've been sort of reliving that as I've been trying to make swords for Genji from Overwatch.</p>
            <p>And obviously, I love playing games. Lately it's been lots of Overwatch 2, some Minecraft. My favorite games of all time probably consist of Outer Wilds, Tunic, Elden Ring, Zelda: Twilight Princess, Minecraft, Terraria, and Black Ops III.</p>
